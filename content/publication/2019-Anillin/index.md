abstract: "RhoA stimulates cell contractility by recruiting downstream effectors to the cortical plasma membrane. We now show that direct binding by anillin is required for effective signaling: this antagonizes the otherwise labile membrane association of GTP-RhoA to promote effector recruitment. However, since its binding to RhoA blocks access by other effectors, we demonstrate that anillin must also concentrate membrane phosphoinositide-4,5-P2 (PIP2) to promote signaling. We propose and test a sequential pathway where GTP-RhoA first binds to anillin and then is retained at the membrane by PIP2 after it disengages from anillin. Importantly, re-binding of membrane GTP-RhoA to anillin, regulated by the cortical density of anillin, creates cycles through this pathway. These cycles repeatedly reset the dissociation kinetics of GTP-RhoA, substantially increasing its dwell time to recruit effectors. Thus, anillin regulates RhoA signaling by a paradigm of kinetic scaffolding that may apply to other signals whose efficacy depends on their cortical dwell times."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "Sometimes, to make something happen, all you need to do is give it more time. We discuss the case of a *kinetic* scaffold, which promotes signalling by inducing a delay."
